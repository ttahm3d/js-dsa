# Stack

Stack is a simple data structure, where elements are added and removed at one end. The last element added is the first element to be deleted. Hence it is called as Last in First Out(LIFO) or First in Last out(FILO) data structure.

- Adding in element is called as **push** operation.
- Removing it is called as **pop** operation.
- The last element is called as **top** element.
- Removing an element when the stack is empty results in **undeflor**.
- Adding element when the stack full is called **overflow**.

### Main operations

1. Push
2. Pop

### Auxilary operations

1. Return the top
2. Return the size
3. Is stack empty?
4. Is stack full?

## Applications

- Implementing function calls (recursion)
- Balancing of symbols
- Expression conversion (infix, postfix and prefix)
