# Recursion

Recursion is a problem solving technique where solution to a problem depends on the solution to smaller instances of the same problem

It is when a function calls itself again and again, until the program hits a base condition.

### Why Recursion?

If we are breaking down a problem into smaller subproblems, reucrsion is very useful

- Base case is necessary to break program
- Recursion might solve the problem in a easy way but it does not gurantee that it will be the fastest solution
